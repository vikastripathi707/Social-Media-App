# Social-Media-App
Reactogram is a social media application built using React.js. The app incorporates a range of features and utilizes various technologies to provide users with a seamless and interactive social media experience.

Key technologies used in the development of Reactogram include React.js, Bootstrap 5, and Node.js Express.js for the backend REST API. React.js is the primary framework for building the user interface, while Bootstrap 5 is used for responsive and visually appealing design elements.

The backend REST API, developed using Node.js Express.js, allows for efficient communication between the front-end and the server. It supports essential operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting user posts. This ensures that users can easily manage and share their content on the platform.

Reactogram incorporates features like user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens. This ensures that user data and interactions are secure. Users can create an account, log in, and access personalized features within the app.

To enhance user experience, the app utilizes various components and functionalities. These include a navigation bar for seamless navigation, a footer for additional information, and posts cards to display user-generated content. The app also includes sections for displaying the latest posts and a call-to-action section for engaging users.

Users can upload and download posts, allowing them to share multimedia content with ease. They can also like and dislike posts, comment on them, and view comments made by other users. Dynamic navigation ensures that the app adapts to user authentication status, showing or hiding options accordingly.

React Redux and React Router DOM are employed to efficiently manage application state and handle routing between different components. This ensures a smooth and responsive user interface.

Overall, Reactogram demonstrates the developer's skills in building a fully functional social media application using React.js. The app incorporates essential features such as user authentication, post management, and interactive functionalities, providing users with an engaging social media experience.
